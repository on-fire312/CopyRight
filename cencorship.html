        <h1>Censorship is a huge moral debate.  To what extent do you agree that there should be censorship of the Internet? 
        </h1>
        I believe that censorship, the control or suppression of information being accessed or published, should exist, but be limited.

<p>For example, many laws have a need for censorship and have been brought in by the general public through democracy. And in my opinion many of these have good reasons  to exist, e.g. copyright. Therefore I believe that any censorship that falls under the realm of keeping the law is correct and should continue.</p>

<p>On the other hand, governments can use censorship negatively. Governments can make curtain content illegal for political advantage or to mislead the public by censoring oppositions or what else is going on in the world. I do not believe this to be morally correct since people deserve to be able to make their own decisions and therefore should be illegal. </p>

<p>There is also an argument over free speech and protecting those who are vulnerable. In my opinion, all information should be accessible to people if they are aware of the dangers involved, whether that of their mental health or to their computer. But I also believe those who are vulnerable should be protected. Because of this, I believe that almost all content that is not illegal, should not be entirely censored, but there should be laws on how easily sensitive information can be accessed. Whether it's more rigorous age verification, or more information on the risks involved. I also believe that there should be more laws on child protection on the monitoring of children's access to the internet where the parent is held responsible for what the child is accessing. I believe that this is becoming more possible because of the tools available today.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I believe that censorship should exist to reinforce the law, but shouldn't be used to hide information by the government. And that anyone who is aware of the risks should be able to access anything, while laws should be introduced to protect those who are vulnerable.</p>
